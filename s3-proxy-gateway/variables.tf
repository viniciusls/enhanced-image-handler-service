  # NOTE: application/octet-stream is the least specific MIME type. It basically just stores the bytes and assumes the consuming application will know what to do with them.
  # On testing it appears you dont need any of the content types below after application/octet-stream. After uploading a variety of different file types I was able to download them all and open
  # them up successfully. The only issue was when issuing a GET request in postman for a jpeg file it would display the encoded bytes instead of the image. However,
  # if you open the same jpeg file up on the desktop in an image-viewer there was no problem. The content types below after the application/octet-stream just assist some applications in opening
  # the files up. Also note there is a limit of 25 media types allowed in aws api gateway.
